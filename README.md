# GPUHubBD

This was like a project I started in early 2023 with some of my friends. We hosted a static website on github and gave it a custom domain (https://gpuhub.tech/) and linked the products that we sold on the website to our facebook page. This is how we took order and we continued this project for the next few months.
Currently, this project scraped by me and to be very honest a learned a lot from it, it was my very first real life experience in building a website that actually helps me in doing something, in this case, selling products. Hope to do something of this sort but at a way larger scale in the future.
